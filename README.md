# design-patterns

This repository contains OOD patterns in C++ based on the [Design Patterns in Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc) playlist by [Christopher Okhravi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbF-4yQQAWw-UnuCd2Azfzg). The playlist (somewhat loosly) follows the book [Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124).


### Places Where Example Sways from Playlist

1. Abstract Factory Pattern: Example sways from the example given in the playlist (that of UI components) or the book (Pizza shop) and introduces a clothes factory for work clothes and day-off clothes.

2. Command Pattern: Example slightly sways from playlist (remote for smart lamp) and introduces an AC remote. Not quite sure about the implementation of this example.
